# Opticars: Innovating Mobility with Eye-Controlled Vehicles
Individuals with limited motor abilities often face challenges accessing technology independently, as well as in physical mobility. Opticars introduces a novel, hands-free solution that utilizes eye tracking technology to maneuver an Arduino car. Our project features a custom-built vehicle, a carefully designed user interface, and an original data preprocessing and streaming pipeline.
